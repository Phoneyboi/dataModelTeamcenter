# Classification
Lets break up the subject of classification into two parts; creating a classification hierarchy, and classifying data.

## Creating a Classification hierarchy
Rule #1, keep it simple. Ask yourself, what are the bare-bones necessities to effectively classify your data? This is not a time to impress everyone with your elaborate classification structure. You will only make enemies doing this. 

Another question to ask yourself after understanding the value of simplicity, what are the downstream business units doing with the classification data they recieve from this work? How are they using classification data to perform their job? Think of the [McMasterCarr ](https://www.mcmaster.com/) website as an example. In a typical business process, the engineers creating the 3D model data will be required to classify the product they create. This classification data can be consumed by their customer-facing website without the need for manual re-entry of data. 

## Classification of Data
In Teamcenter, the data that is being classified is the Item Revision. The contents of the Item Revision define what is classified.
